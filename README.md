# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project

Robin, an astro-enthusiast after a lot of imputs and hardwork created her web app. The app is functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To full her requirement, we have used a combinatio of "MongoDB" and "FLASK" web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mars Mission, which even inlcudes high defination pictures, and displays the information in a single HTML Page.  

We have used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
